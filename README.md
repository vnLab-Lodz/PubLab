    $ git clone git@github.com:vnLab-Lodz/PubLab.git

    # HTTPS
    $ git clone https://github.com/vnLab-Lodz/PubLab.git
    ```

2.  Create an OAuth Application on GitHub

    2a. Enter profile's **Settings** section

    2b. Select **Developer Settings** -> **OAuth Apps** -> **New OAuth App**

    2c. Pick name for the application (it won't affect the project) and specify **Home page URL** and **Authorization callback URL** and register your application

        Home page URL: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize

        Authorization callback URL: http://localhost/main_window

    2d. Inside **Client secrets** section generate a new client secret
